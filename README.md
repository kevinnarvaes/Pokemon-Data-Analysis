# Pokemon-Data-Analysis
A WIP dashboard built in PBI, focused around pokémon types, abilities, stats and more!

Based on the pokémon database created by Rounak Banik, hosted in https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon 
this is PBI report featuring simple data cleaning in Power Query, setting the right tables to get the full power of Power BI's dimensional modeling,
and a dashboard showing all sorts of counts of pokémon based on defined atributes as ther Type, Abilities, Experience Growth Group, Ablities and more.
In order to count pokémon by type, and making sure the for example, a Gengar, which is poison and ghost type, is counted in both types categories. This
same logic applies with abilities since a pokémon may have more than one possible ability.

Whenever the type slicer is used, some of the colors in the graphs will change accordingly. This was done using a Pokemon Type dimension hosting the 
hex color codes and using PBI's conditional formatting capabilities.

All sorts of different slicer combinations can be made, so interesting facts can be obtained from it. Which is the strongest electric pokémo from Gen 1?
How many psychic pokémon have the ability Magic Bounce.

More features will be added as more work is put into it.
